## Project Descriptiom
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying heartbeats based on ECG signals. Using the ECG Arrhythmia Image Dataset, which includes heartbeat signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, the model will differentiate between normal and abnormal heart rhythms.The neural network will analyze ECG images and classify heartbeats into categories such as normal, arrhythmia, and myocardial infarction. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to contribute to automated arrhythmia detection, which could support early diagnosis and intervention in cardiovascular diseases. The data set was found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erhmrai/ecg-image-data
